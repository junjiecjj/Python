This MATLAB script demonstrates a cognitive radar demo where two moving targets (a car and a pedestrian) are sensed in a dynamic environment containing clutter and interference.

Using a 2D CA-CFAR detector, the radar estimates detections and adaptively reallocates its bandwidth and power across the scene, focusing transmit energy toward the most salient regions in real time.
