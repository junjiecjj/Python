# OFDM-ISAC-Beyond-CP-Limit
The sensing performance of OFDM-ISAC systems is often limited by CP (Content Capability). To avoid ISI (Interference Separation) and ICI (Interference Separation), this project reproduces two papers from the paper "OFDM-ISAC Beyond CP Limit: Performance Analysis and Mitigation Algorithms".
