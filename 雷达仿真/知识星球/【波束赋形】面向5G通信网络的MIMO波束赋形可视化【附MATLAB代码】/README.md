# MIMO Beamforming Simulation

This MATLAB project simulates and visualizes multi-device wireless communication using MIMO (Multiple-Input, Multiple-Output) beamforming. It compares the performance of MIMO beamforming with SISO (Single-Input, Single-Output) under varying device positions and signal conditions.

## üìå Features

- Simulates base station with 8-antenna linear array
- Randomly places user devices with minimum separation constraints
- Supports multiple simultaneous communications
- Dynamically updates device positions over several iterations
- Compares MIMO vs SISO received power and SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio)
- Visualizes:
  - Device layout and communication paths
  - Real-time data flow animation
  - Beam pattern of the antenna array
  - Power comparison bar plots

## üß† Technologies

- MATLAB
- Concepts: MIMO, SISO, MMSE Beamforming, Path Loss, Random Walk, Wireless Communication

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

1. **Run the script:**  
   Open `code.m` in MATLAB and run the script.

2. **User Input:**  
   - Enter the number of simultaneous communications (1 to 10)
   - For each communication:
     - Specify number of participating devices (2 to `min(numDevices, numAntennas-1)`)
     - Select devices (by ID)

3. **Visualization:**  
   The simulation will animate device movements, beam patterns, and received power comparisons for each iteration.

## üìä Outputs

- Animated plot of device movement and communication links
- Polar plot showing the beam pattern of the antenna array
- Final bar graph comparing MIMO and SISO performance per communication
- Console printout of SINR and received power metrics
