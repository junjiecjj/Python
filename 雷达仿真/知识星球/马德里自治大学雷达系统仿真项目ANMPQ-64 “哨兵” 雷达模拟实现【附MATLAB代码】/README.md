## Introduction

Radar technology plays a crucial role in various fields, including telecommunications, aviation, and automotive safety. This project simulates a pulsed radar system, focusing on key aspects such as noise modeling, target detection, and signal processing. The simulation provides insights into radar operations and enhances understanding of radar principles.

## Features

- **Pulsed Radar Simulation**: Simulates the behavior of a pulsed radar system.
- **Moving Targets**: Models fluctuating targets to evaluate detection capabilities.
- **Parameter Calculation**: Calculates essential radar parameters.
- **PPI and A-Scope Visualization**: Displays radar data in intuitive formats.
- **Signal Processing**: Implements techniques for effective signal analysis.
- **Noise Modeling**: Accounts for environmental noise in simulations.

- **results/**: Stores output data from the simulation.

## Simulation Details

### Parameters

The radar simulation requires various parameters, including:

- **Pulse Width**: Duration of each pulse.
- **Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)**: Rate at which pulses are transmitted.
- **Operating Frequency**: Frequency of the radar signal.
- **Detection Threshold**: Minimum signal level for target detection.

Adjust these parameters in the `run_simulation.m` file to tailor the simulation to your needs.

### Target Detection

The project implements several algorithms for target detection, including:

- **Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)**: Adjusts the detection threshold based on noise levels.
- **Swerling Models**: Models target behavior under different conditions.

Experiment with different algorithms to see how they affect detection performance.

## Visualization

The simulation includes visualization tools for better understanding of radar data:

- **PPI Display**: Presents the radar data in a polar plot.
- **A-Scope**: Shows the signal strength over time for a specific range.

To visualize the results, call the `visualize_results.m` function after running the simulation.
