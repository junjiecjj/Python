# Optimization for Wireless Communications

This is the repository for simulation codes for the published papers of STAR Lab@QMUL based on convex optimization and related mathematical tools. The research areas of interest includes but are not limited to: 
- Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) surface / Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)
- Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) / Next-generation multiple access (NGMA)
- Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)

Most of the codes are developed based on [MATLAB](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/).
