## Introduction
The Matlab Simulation codes for Hybrid Beamforming for Millimeter Wave Systems Using the MMSE Criterion.
This paper on published in IEEE transactions on communications in Jan 2019.

Also, I recommend my rencent work that using deep learning to solve the HBF design problem. This work can be referred to

and all codes are openned at [this repo](https://github.com/TianLin0509/BF-design-with-DL).



I only update the codes for narrowband cases, but the extension to broadband is straightforward. which can be referred to my another repository named "August_mmwave", [gateway](https://github.com/TianLin0509/August_mmwave). however, the later is written in a bad form so not easy to read. I don't have enough time now, so maybe it will be updated in the future.

## How to use
This code is really is to use. First, you should totally add all packages to the path, so you can use these functions. Then, just run the ```main_vs_SNR.m``` file directly. 

## Content
This codes including several algorithms mentioned in my paper, all can easily cited by these convenient APIs. 

## End
I won't update it recently because of limitation of time. However, if you have any problems, you can directly contact me by e-mail: ```lint17@fudan.edu.cn```, I'm glad to help you.

Besides, the broadband codes can be referred to [here](https://github.com/TianLin0509/August_mmwave).
