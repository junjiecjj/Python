KalmanFilter
============

Some simple applications of a Kalman filter. Output from the filter is compared with 
measurements, the actual position and a moving average. Matplotlib is used for
visualisation.

railtruck_example.py - railtruck subject to random accelerations
voltmeter_example.py - noisy measurement of a constant voltage
kalman_filter.py - simple Kalman filter
helper_utils - used to visualise the output from the examples
